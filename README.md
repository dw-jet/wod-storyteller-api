# Old World of Darkness Helper API
An API of helper tools for people storytelling old world of darkness games. 

## Why?
I build tools for my personal oWoD games, but they're spread out across a bunch of programs written in different languages. This aims to centralize common fuctionality like dice rolling and generating disposable henchmen.

## Status
This is not ready for use by anyone. More code and documentation is coming soon.
